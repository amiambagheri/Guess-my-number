# Guess-my-number

## A simple game using HTML CSS and JavaScript for learning work with DOM and DOM manipulation.

 I used:

`Math` object, `document` object, `addEventListener` method, event handler, `if-else` statement, `function` expression, `querySelector` method, styling manipulation with CSS property in JavaScript, etc.

Refactor: In the end, to ensure compliance with the DRY principle, I reviewed the code, condensed duplicate sections, and used functions to refactor repetitive code.
